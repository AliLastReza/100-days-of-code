# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
* Read most of the 100daysofcode.com home page and did most of the stuff
* Publicly committed to the challenge in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AliLastReza/status/1602935287654522880?s=20&t=cfnyJjJf5s3HR4pT5rigsg) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alilastreza_100daysofcode-activity-7008701332173774848-hpWx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
* Sent a DM to Alex Kallaway and let him know about Slack broken link
* Read the original article: [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/)
* Planned what I'm going to work on
* At launch time I decided to watch a React course, so I can later create a whole online store with Python, Django, React, etc...
* I did first 3 exercises of [React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library [2022]](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8)
  * [First react ex-1](https://github.com/AliLastReza/ReactCourse-Playground/commit/b98f26c4ec13810e2e112d71526ba7774c94c1b8)
  * First React Practice (forgot to commit)
  * [Why React?, ex-1](https://github.com/AliLastReza/ReactCourse-Playground/commit/d0ce869c2a57f3db6ed955711e5356bc27d41bba)

**Thoughts:** It was good but basic. I wanted to work on a complete online store. But because I saw React tutorials at launch, wanted to practice it.

### Day 1: December 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

* Created [Full-Stack-Online-Shop repo](4f549819d59a1272ca65b0e91440b0cdd292f971), and defined some basics, like "What It's going to be?" and "How to accomplish that? and what are the details?" ([commit](b45d9cd569ebeb1f50d0cca9613bf3bf1c99e43b))
* Wrote 2 services of docker-compose and backend/Dockerfile file ([commit](be1022adc4b8dfcb8cba0c32ca62e97d141a1e3e))

**Thoughts:** As of today, I hadn't written a docker-compose and Dockerfile, I had worked with them but hadn't started a project with them. It was nice to start a project from scratch with a docker-compose and Dockerfile :)

### Day 2: December 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

* Completed docker-compose.yml, it's working, refactored to version 3.9, added envs
* Wrote `requirements.md`, "General Idea" and "Client's Requirements" sections
* Added `.env` to local development
* Fixed a lot of bugs about `docker-compose.yml`
* Completed `settings.py` for now
* Installed django, django-oscar, django-environ and started the project with them

**Thoughts:** Now I have some better experiences in docker compose, django-oscar, Dockerfile. Today I put more time to it and got better result. And I feel every day I get more interested about coding more.

### Day 3: December 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

* Wrote some parts of "Building an e-commerce site: the key questions", "Apps and Models" in requirements.md
* Wrote first draft of Oscar's status pipline, hided "reviews", "wishlists" features
* Created a .gitignore from toptal.com
* Forked Django-Oscar's shipping app

**Thoughts:** Now I have some better experiences in docker compose, django-oscar, Dockerfile. Today I put more time to it and got better result. And I feel every day I get more interested about coding more.

### Day 4: December 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

* I was working on a private project, Upwork crawler. It seems Upwork blocks crawlers. So I can't use python's `requests` package.

**Thoughts:** It's a hard task and I better be more patient.

### Day 5: December 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

* Worked on Upwork's crawler, wrote a small README.md
* Learned some new stuff about crawling, inspected network, tried to request like web browser

**Thoughts:** I'm going in the right direction I think :)

### Day 6: December 20, 2022

**Today's Progress (Full-Stack-Online-Shop project)**:

* Fixed a bug in `apps.shipping.repository.Repository.get_available_shipping_methods`
* Tried setting up "add to cart" to "Successful purchase" journey. Saw countries' drop down doesn't show any country, figured out it's because all countries shipping flag is False, fixed it.
* Tried to install and setup Paypal gateway. It just supports Django 2.2 and I'm using 3.2 so searched to decide what I better do

**Thoughts:** Coding 1 hour a day is great and hard at the same time :)
