# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
* Read most of the 100daysofcode.com home page and did most of the stuff
* Publicly committed to the challenge in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AliLastReza/status/1602935287654522880?s=20&t=cfnyJjJf5s3HR4pT5rigsg) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alilastreza_100daysofcode-activity-7008701332173774848-hpWx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
* Sent a DM to Alex Kallaway and let him know about Slack broken link
* Read the original article: [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/)
* Planned what I'm going to work on
* At launch time I decided to watch a React course, so I can later create a whole online store with Python, Django, React, etc...
* I did first 3 exercises of [React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library [2022]](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8)
  * [First react ex-1](https://github.com/AliLastReza/ReactCourse-Playground/commit/b98f26c4ec13810e2e112d71526ba7774c94c1b8)
  * First React Practice (forgot to commit)
  * [Why React?, ex-1](https://github.com/AliLastReza/ReactCourse-Playground/commit/d0ce869c2a57f3db6ed955711e5356bc27d41bba)

**Thoughts:** It was good but basic. I wanted to work on a complete online store. But because I saw React tutorials at launch, wanted to practice it.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
